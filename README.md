# Digit-Recognition

The following project is using the MNIST dataset (hand-written digits 0-9) and using machine learning to correctly classify them.

## Goal
In addition to using the MNIST dataset, a fresh set of digits, written and preprocessed by me, were also used. The MNIST dataset 
mainly served as a training set and my own dataset, was used for testing.

## Platforms
Two machine learning libraries were used for the classification, scikit-learn and Keras.

### scikit-learn
```
training.py
```
and 
```
test.py
```

### Keras
```
digits_k.py
```
